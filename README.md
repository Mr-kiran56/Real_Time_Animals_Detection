🚀 **Real-Time Animal Detection & Counting Using YOLOv8 + SORT Tracker** 🐘🐎🐄

I'm excited to share my latest Computer Vision project — a real-time **Animal Detection & Counting system** built with:
✅ **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** for high-performance object detection
✅ **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)** for unique ID tracking
✅ **OpenCV + Python** for visualization and video processing
✅ **cvzone** for better annotated output

🎯 **What it does:**

* Detects and tracks animals like **elephants, cows, horses, zebras, and bears**
* Assigns unique IDs to each detected animal
* Avoids duplicate counting
* Displays real-time count of each animal class on the screen
* Lightweight and runs smoothly on video input

🔍 **Technologies used:**

* `YOLOv8n.pt` model
* `cvzone`, `NumPy`, `OpenCV`, `SORT`, and `Ultralytics`
* Python-based tracking and counting logic
